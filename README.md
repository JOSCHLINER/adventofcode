# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual Coding Advent calendar created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz), it consists of two coding problems each day the user may solve. In this repository, you can find my solution to the problems presented.
They may not be the fastest, or most efficient but they work.  If you want to participate yourself, the challenges are up all year on the official website ([https://adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com)) and can be solved on any hardware that has an OS installed and an internet connection. Pull requests are not accepted (would surprise me if anyone would do that) as these are my solutions and not a project.
